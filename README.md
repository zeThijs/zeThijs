<pre>   Hi 
This place will contain projects in (mostly) working state. 
Currently this is mostly vscript-/sourcemod-plugins for nmrih, and python scripts. 
Future me (from 2023) is sure to add other tinkering.

   About me
I love modding, programming and electrical engineering. 
I'm from the Netherlands, so you can probably buy my loyalty with cheese or clogs.
